Version 1.0 - 11 September 2009

Starting with Version 2.0, the MusicXML format includes a standard zip compressed version. These zip files can contain multiple MusicXML files as well as other media files for images and sound. The container schema describes the contents of the META-INF/container.xml file. The container describes the starting point for the MusicXML version of the file, as well as alternate renditions such as PDF and audio versions of the musical score.

The MusicXML 2.0 zip file format is compatible with the zip format used by the java.util.zip package and Java JAR files. It is based on the Info-ZIP format described at:

	ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/archiving/zip/doc/appnote-970311-iz.zip

The JAR file format is specified at:

	http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html

Note that, compatible with JAR files, file names should be encoded in UTF-8 format. 

Files with the zip container are compressed the DEFLATE algorithm. The DEFLATE Compressed Data Format (RFC 1951) is specified at:

	http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt

The recommended file suffix for OSF files is .osf. The recommended media type for an Open Score Format package file is:

		application/vnd.yamaha.openscoreformat

The recommended media type for an OSF PVG profile MusicXML score is:

		application/vnd.yamaha.openscoreformat.osfpvg+xml

Open Score Format specifies additional constraints on container files than does MusicXML 2.0. See the Open Score Format Packaging Specification for further details.

Open Score Format uses XSD for all its XML format definitions. This container.xsd file is an XSD version of MusicXML 2.0's container.dtd file.</xs:documentation>

A MusicXML file used as a rootfile may have score-partwise, score-timewise, or opus as its document element.</xs:documentation>
